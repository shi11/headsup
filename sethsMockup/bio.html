<p>Scott holds a Masters degree in Psychology (California State Fresno, 1972) and a Doctorate in Man-Environment Relations (Pennsylvania State University, 1977). His academic areas of study were consumer decision-making, social processes and attitude formation, branding and image communication, and urban environmental stress.</p>

His published research appeared in such professional journals as <i>Environment and Behavior</i> and the <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i>.</p> 
<p>To apply his behavioral science tools to more real-world issues, he shifted his focus from academics to business marketing and research (quantitative and qualitative). On the advertising agency side he spent 1979-1986 in the Research departments of BBDO (New York) and D’Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles (New York). He also gained research supplier-side experience during 1986-88 as Senior Vice President, Ted Dunn Research Associates, and Vice President/Client Services at Research International, both in New York.</p> 
<p>In 1989 he became Partner in The B/R/S Group Inc., a leading U.S. qualitative research-based marketing consultancy. He became Managing Director of its New York office in 1992, and managed its growth to 150+ qualitative projects and revenues of US$3.0+ million in 2000.</p> 
<p>In 2001 he founded his own marketing consultancy, Heads up! Research, Inc., based in New York.  From this platform he offers clients the benefit of his academic training, business experience, and business approach: highly-crafted, rigorously controlled, strategically-rich research and marketing consulting to domestic marketers and the international marketing community.</p> 
<p>Scott has been active in qualitative research—both academic and business—for over 30 years, and has honed his skills in virtually every major product and service category. His work has significantly impacted such diverse brands as Activision electronic games, American Express, British Airways, Camel cigarettes, Canon office systems, Ericsson telecommunications, Heineken beer, JVC consumer electronics, L'Oreal cosmetics/fragrances, Rolex watches, and Shell automotive products.</p> 
<p>His qualitative research specialty areas include branding (positioning, equity/extension, image-identity engineering), new product development, and consumer communications (particularly advertising and packaging design). He is recognized for his innovative interviewing techniques, interest in consumer psychological/emotional motivations, strategic focus, and client partnership skills.</p>

<a name="annie"><b>Annie Hayward</b></a>
<p>Annie graduated from Carleton College in 2000 with a B/A in Sociology/Anthropology.</p>
<p>Driven by the desire for a real immersion experience and to achieve fluency in Spanish, Annie relocated to the city of Morelia, Mexico where, after designing and teaching a service-oriented English course to employees of several hotels and restaurants, she joined the staff of La Casa del Portal. There she served as a customer liaison for English-speaking clients in the business' restaurant, gallery, and furniture design/sale division, as well as utilized her American perspective to design and implement marketing strategies targeting tourists both domestic and international in local hotels. One year in Mexico resulted in the fluency Annie had sought, as well as a pervading appreciation of and sensitivity towards the intricacies of cultural differences.</p>
<p>Returning to New York in 2001, Annie took a position at the venerable publishing advertising agency, Spier New York. From 2001-2005, working closely with the company's President & CEO, she held various (and simultaneous) positions in the company's publishing advertising group; its consumer advertising division (The Lord Group); its entertainment/education division (shadowbox marketing); and its multicultural marketing partnership (Nclusive Communications). In each, Annie held both intra- and extra-agency roles, aiding in business strategy and PR efforts as well as executing Account Executive positions.</p>
<p>Also at Spier, Annie discovered qualitative research. First, she collaborated on select projects with Mad Logic, the qualitative research division of sister agency Mad Dogs & Englishmen. She then assisted in Spier's effort to bring qualitative research to the publishing community, the result of which was the Spier's Dialog Online, an online advisory panels of "influencers" in the African American, Hispanic, Older Adult and teen market segments, and an innovative research tool granting publishers comparatively low-cost, short-notice access to a national audience. Annie helped grow this unique qualitative capability from the ground up and handled all its day-to-day operations, including tooling the resulting insights into industry-specific sound bites and reports. </p>
<p>To leverage this experience toward more full-blown qualitative research expertise, Annie turned to the most accomplished professional she could think of: her dad. Before joining Heads Up! full-time, Annie spent a full year 'shadowing Scott', gradually integrating herself into the business in which she now enjoys full, active partnership. Areas of particular interest for Annie are brand/product/concept analysis, projective techniques and ensuring client satisfaction.</p>
<p>Annie lives happily in Brooklyn, NY, where she runs, reads, cooks and blogs (<a href="http://www.threadmettle.com/">http://www.threadmettle.com/</a>) in her spare time.</p>
