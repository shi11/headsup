<p>The business of Heads Up! is marketing consulting based on qualitative research. Its client base consists of marketers across the U.S. and the international business community.</p>
<p>The Company is a partnership of its founder, Scott Hayward, Ph.D., and his daughter, Annie Hayward.</p>
<p>Heads Up! works from an unusual client service platform: a familial, multi-generational <i>team</i> offering a unique combination of academic training, business experience, and client service approach.</p>
<p>
<h4>Training</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scott has a strong Social Sciences background and advanced academic training in Psychology and Human Behavior. His doctoral studies and university teaching give him a singular vantage point for understanding the dynamics of consumer attitude formation, decision-making, brand bonding, and general marketplace behavior.</li>
<li>Annie shares this Social Science orientation with a dual undergraduate college degree (Sociology and Anthropology). Her postgraduate experience living and working in Mexico helped to broaden and focus her observational and cultural analytic skills, and refine her fluent command of Spanish. Her years of teamwork with Scott have shaped for her a shared perspective on understanding and marketing to the consumer mind.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Experience</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scott has spent 30 years refining this perspective, and—using qualitative research—applying it to enable marketers to make better strategic and tactical business decisions. His competitive edge is honed from decades of Advertising and Research agency experience addressing business issues across dozens of industry segments.</li>
<li>Since 2005, Annie has absorbed every facet of activity at Heads Up!, working in direct partnership with Scott. Before this, she amassed five years of experience in the Advertising agency world, working in the areas of publishing, general consumer, multicultural, and entertainment & education marketing.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Service Approach</h4>
The Haywards use a team approach uniformly in all aspects of client service. This co-partnering approach allows:
<br>
<ul>
<li>FREEDOM from the internal organizational demands of managing a larger group</li>
<li>FLEXIBILITY of two operatives in tailoring each project (costs, timing, analytic approach) to each client's specific needs</li>
<li>FOCUS of two minds on each set of client issues, on the research discovery process, and on maximizing strategic value of our consulting product</li>
</ul>
<p>These 3 cornerstones—training, experience, and service approach—infuse pervasive <i>added value</i> into each aspect of Heads Up! service to clients, from the most mundane logistic elements to the final bottom line of insights, answers, and clear direction for moving forward.</p>
<p>The end benefit to clients? Tangible research craftsmanship: strategic perspective, vision, creativity, energy, and precision of method seldom found in today's marketplace.</p>
